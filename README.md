ScreenText2 is designed to show the progress of automated tests on an i2C screen.
The tests involved could take 30 minutes or more because they involved replaying scenarios of cars driving in real-time.
The program allows custom messages ('Test complete!') to be sent.
You can also send countdowns that show how much of a timer has expired.
It's designed to be versatile enough that the i2C screen can be used for new things that weren't anticipated at the start of a project.
